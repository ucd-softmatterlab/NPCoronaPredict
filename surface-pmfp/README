Source matching has been applied to source =  SU-ions, SSD class 1, surface defined by U_C(h=0.2) = 35 convention. Recommended LJ cutoff 1.0 nm.
Figures: Blue gives the simple average of contributing PMFs (black lines). Green, where existent, is the reference metadynamics PMF.

HIS averaging: HID 0.14621171572600097 HIE 0.5848468629040039 HIP 0.2689414213699952
It is recommended that HIS charge in UA is set to 0.2689414213699952 for consistency
