How to run:
./UnitedAtom --config-file=name_of_config_file.config

The expected output is a set of .map files in the results folder named in the config file. Each map file is named:
PDBID_(NP radius in nm)_(zeta potential in microvolts)_(angle of rotation of NP in degrees).map and contains data in the form
phi theta energy error

A sample config file is provided and most options are self-explanatory. Some require more explanation as provided below:

The geometry of the NP is defined by the radius and the np-type variable. The options for this are given by:
1 = sphere (Planar PMF)
2 = cylinder  (Planar PMF) 
3 = cube (Planar PMF)
4 = SWCNT ( Cylindrical PMF of diameter 1.5nm , finite thickness tube for vdW)
5 = MWCNT (Cylindrical PMF of diameter 1.5nm, full cylinder for vdW)


If the recalculate-zp option is set to 1 then the input zeta potential is taken to be the zeta potential for a particle of radius 1 nm in a solution with debye length 1 nm and Bjerrum length 1 nm. The zeta potential applied to
a given particle is then adjusted to ensure that the surface charge density of the NP is a constant regardless of the radius. 

Setting the calculate-mfpt flag to 1 makes the code estimate the mean-first passage time for each orientation and save this to _mfpt.map files. This is very slow and is mostly of use if you want to be more rigorous for corona studies. 
This output must also be corrected for the diffusion coefficient of the protein in question.
